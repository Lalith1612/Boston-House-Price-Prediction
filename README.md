The Boston Housing Dataset contains information about housing prices in the suburbs of Boston. It has been widely used in regression tasks for predicting housing prices and is one of the most well-known datasets in the machine learning community. This dataset is primarily used for regression tasks to predict the MEDV (Median value of homes) based on the other attributes. It provides a good starting point for exploring feature relationships, data preprocessing techniques, and different regression algorithms.
